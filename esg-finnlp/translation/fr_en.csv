For older people today, old age is something they never thought about, and the solutions are imposed on them.

Called BarMar, it will link Barcelona to Marseille by sea and should transport green hydrogen produced from renewable energies by 2030. However, concerns have been expressed about the wisdom of launching such an infrastructure without being sure that renewable electricity production capacity, which is set to grow sharply, will follow, and before knowing exactly what the market needs.",Opportunity
"Goodbye MidCat, hello BarMar. While the gas pipeline project linking France to Spain via the Pyrenees was finally abandoned in the face of Emmanuel Macron's fierce opposition, a new pipeline project will replace it, linking Barcelona to Marseille by sea.

"The project, also known as H2Med, is part of the European Union's hydrogen strategy and is designed to transport green hydrogen, produced from renewable electricity or nuclear power, in the France-Spain direction. The agreement in principle initially mentioned that it could transport natural gas on a transitory basis, which caused concern among many observers. They pointed the finger at a disguised gas pipeline, and an expensive stranded asset - the project is estimated to cost 2.5 billion euros. In the end, however, it will only transport hydrogen, so that it can be declared a ""project of common interest"" and benefit from European funding.",Opportunity

What would have to be transported is the low-carbon electricity produced in Spain, to be used for electrolysis at the production sites that would need the hydrogen. We need more electricity interconnections; I'm not convinced we need more gas interconnections, which have greater consequences for the environment and ecosystems in particular"". Meanwhile, the President seems to have changed his mind.",Risk

This was another major bone of contention. In the end, local authorities will be able to indicate areas where renewable energy projects can be accelerated, in particular through tax incentives. For the application phase of these priority or favourable zones, the mayor's assent will be required. For locations outside these priority zones, the LR deputies failed to obtain a right of veto from the mayors on any given project. The government is arguing for a balance between zones where renewable energies will be favored, with the assent of mayors, zones where all projects will be excluded, and neutral zones, with no prohibitions or incentives.",Opportunity
"4/ Mapping priority areas for offshore wind farms
Another measure aims to facilitate the launch of new projects through less complex consultation procedures with local stakeholders. It introduces planning for offshore wind power. The first ""priority"" zones are to be mapped out by 2024. These will have to be located in the exclusive economic zone, at least 22 km from the coast. But this is not an obligation, much to the dismay of MPs from various benches. Emmanuel Macron has set the goal of deploying 50 offshore wind farms to reach 40 gigawatts by 2050.

"5/ Taking visual saturation into account
Members of parliament have maintained an article in the bill on renewable energies stipulating that authorization to operate a wind turbine must take into account visual saturation and the need to diversify energy sources, despite the fears of the presidential camp that this would be a breeding ground for litigation. Added in committee on the initiative of ecologist Delphine Batho, the article stipulates that authorization to operate a wind turbine in a given territory must take into account ""the electricity production capacity, the number of installations (...) already existing in the territory concerned, the need to diversify renewable energy sources locally and to prevent the effects of visual saturation"".",Opportunity

The former has simply ruled out the use of coal on the grounds that its sulfur content is too high, and the latter will gradually turn to the production of green steel, as European steelmakers are also doing.

The war in Ukraine has little to do with the situation we find ourselves in today in France.

Firstly, delays in investment in the upkeep and maintenance of reactors, which is not, as we often hear, the fault of the State or of changing policies which, I would remind you, concerned the pace of plant closures. There was Covid, which certainly cost us a little time, but that was two years ago. This lack of investment was compounded by the discovery of major corrosion problems in some fifteen reactors. As a result, our production of nuclear-generated electricity has fallen, while consumption has not. As a result, we now import a lot of electricity from our European neighbors, who are affected by the war in Ukraine because they produce electricity from gas, particularly in Germany, from which we obtain our supplies. This has led to a reduction in supply and a surge in prices, which is having an impact on us because we're having to import electricity, whereas we used to export it.",Opportunity

Taking into account spare parts such as helmets, locks and tires, the French bicycle market is now worth 3.4 billion euros. This trend is all the more significant given that these figures do not take into account the sale of second-hand bikes. ""There's a real euphoria,"" says Virgile Caillet. But the momentum could have been lost, given the tensions that have arisen throughout the supply chain as a result of the health crisis. Between the explosion in demand and the shutdown of certain factories, the industry was put to the test, with deliveries of certain parts being extended by several weeks or even months.",Opportunity

"Not yet a bicycle country
""There is a social phenomenon, but it would be premature to say that France has once again become a bicycle country,"" says Virgile Caillet. ""When the French buy 2.8 million bicycles, the Germans go up to 4 million"". Hence the importance of supporting this transition. Two essential factors need to be taken into account. Firstly, safety and the development of cycle paths. Last September, at the presentation of France's ""bicycle plan"", launched in 2018, Ecological Transition Minister Barbara Pompili and Transport Minister Jean-Baptiste Djebbari estimated a 30% increase in cycle paths in three years. 53,000 km of infrastructure have been deployed in France.",Opportunity
"""We need strong political support to maintain the momentum,"" believes Virgile Caillet, who points out that the second factor in the success of this transition is the fight against bicycle theft and damage. Here, too, infrastructure needs to be adapted. With this in mind, in February the government made it compulsory for bicycles sold by professionals to be marked. The bike is then registered in the Fichier national unique des cycles identifiés (Fnuci), enabling the authorities to return the bike to its owner in the event of theft.",Opportunity
"In the run-up to the presidential election, Novethic takes a look at these forgotten debates, the ones that don't occupy the media spotlight but are nonetheless vital. Today's focus is on sustainable mobility, with Laura Foglia, Mobility Project Manager at the Shift Project. The think tank has published a sector-by-sector plan for transforming the economy to achieve carbon neutrality.",Opportunity
"In your view, sustainable mobility shouldn't just be about getting around, but also about shortening distances. What does this mean?
It involves questioning the urbanization model that developed after the Second World War, commonly referred to as the ""car years"". As the population grew, suburbanization became widespread, and many areas were designed to accommodate automobile traffic. At the same time, commercial centers and industrial zones were relocated outside city centers. Today, it's very difficult to turn back the clock, as habits have become entrenched.",Risk
"But a policy of sustainable mobility requires a reduction in distances, because the gains in terms of CO2 emissions recorded for vehicles have been more than offset by the increase in distances. For daily mobility alone, our journeys have increased by 50% compared with the 1980s. And for mobility in general, both daily and long-distance, distances have multiplied by 4.7 since the 60s. That's not to say that we shouldn't switch to less carbon-intensive modes of transport, but we mustn't forget the essential component of the distances we travel.",Risk
"What can be done to recreate proximity?
There are many things we can do. For example, for future projects, we could introduce moratoria on commercial or business zones located outside city centers, far from existing public transport or inaccessible by bike or on foot. For example, we could decide not to support a company that locates far from the center and from any public transport network, because of the price of land. What often happens, however, is that the company, once established, asks the public authorities to provide transport solutions. In this case, it's the community that serves private profit. This logic must be reversed.",Opportunity
"As far as existing areas are concerned, we need to reintroduce local services, stores, schools and workplaces, and focus on a functional mix of spaces. Even in the least densely populated areas, we need to be able to access basic services without having to use the car. The quarter-hour city, advocated by a number of prominent figures, sums up this principle quite well, but it has to be a quarter-hour spent in a low-carbon mode, on foot or by bike.",Opportunity
"How do you make this model desirable?
Today, one of the black spots in mobility is SUVs (they are the second biggest contributor to CO2 emissions, ahead of planes and ships, editor's note). We need to reverse this trend by regulating their advertising, for example, and reflect on the fact that owning an SUV is not very sensible in the face of the energy crises that are set to multiply. It's becoming increasingly strategic to encourage people to use lighter vehicles, bicycles or on foot. We need to redirect people's desires towards something other than driving for miles. An encouraging example comes from cycling, which has long been trivialized and devalued because modernity was embodied by the car. Today, it's going against the tide, with an explosion in sales. What we need to do is make desirable an imaginary world linked to local life.",Risk

"Indeed, Uniden warns that some companies have been forced to shut down certain workshops. Zinc and ammonia manufacturers, for example, have temporarily closed certain sites to avoid producing at a loss, as have the Yara and Borealis groups, which produce 40% of the ammonia manufactured in France. French faucet manufacturer Kramer (ex-Jacob Delafon) had to make a similar decision at a plant producing high-end ceramic sanitaryware.

Other companies are taking the initiative to avoid these cost increases. Indeed, even if the surge in energy prices is accentuated by the war in Ukraine, experts are unanimous in saying that the rise in energy costs is structural. It will not abate over time. ""All the criteria are in place for a sustained rise in prices,"" confirms Jean-Sébastien Degouve, President and co-founder of Opéra Energie, an energy broker. Companies are therefore being encouraged to transform themselves to consume less energy.",Opportunity
"Industries are on the hunt to cut waste and reduce energy consumption wherever possible. ""We're working throughout the supply chain to use the least energy-intensive materials at every stage of production,"" says Tanguy Robert, CEO of consulting firm Sami. Others are investing to upgrade their production tools. ""Jean-Sébastien Degouve confirms: ""With sustained high energy prices, this is becoming profitable.",Risk
"Corporate interest in renewable energies
More and more companies are also turning to renewable energies. ""Many of our customers want to use their own energy,"" confirms Jean-Sébastien Degouve. Groups such as Casino, Leclerc, Carrefour, Castorama, Auchan, Leroy Merlin and Ikea have been moving in this direction for several years, installing solar panels on store roofs or supermarket parking lots. However, this possibility remains limited as ""the groups must own their premises and the sites must be able to accommodate photovoltaic panels"", explains Jean-Sébastien Degouve.",Opportunity
"The energy broker also recommends that customers turn to PPAs (Power Purchase Agreements), over-the-counter supply contracts between customer and energy supplier. These contracts for the purchase of energy directly from producers are attracting real interest from companies, which can thus decarbonize their uses and secure long-term fixed prices. After the SNCF and Google, Décathlon, Boulanger and Carrefour have all turned to this solution. ""But demand for these projects is outstripping supply,"" points out Jean-Sébastien Degouve. With the latest IPCC report clearly calling for a shift away from fossil fuels, companies are likely to continue to flock to these solutions, also to reduce their carbon footprint. More and more companies are joining the RE100 network and committing to a 100% renewable energy target by 2028 on average, and by 2030 at the latest.",Opportunity
"Five fossil fuel companies, including RWE, Uniper and Rockhopper, are attacking European countries over their climate commitments.

"3.7 billion euros is the precise sum that five energy companies are demanding from four European Union member states for their climate policies.
